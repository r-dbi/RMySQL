Version 0.7-3

* Added mysqlClientLibraryVersions() which returns the compiled and
  loaded client library versions as a vector.

* RMySQL will now check for MySQL minor version consistency and throw
  an error when the client and loaded library versions don't match.

Version 0.7-2

* New maintainer is Jeffrey Horner <jeff.horner@vanderbilt.edu>.

* We no longer distribute libmysql.dll. This library is now found
  either by reading the MYSQL_HOME environment variable or by reading
  the windows registry entries.

* Removed dependence on MySQL C function load_defaults() as it was
  meant for command-line tools, not for (re)connecting to a database.

* Fixed \r issue with dbWriteTable().

* Tests have been added and depend on proper values set in the
  environment variables MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, and MYSQL_PASSWD.

Version 0.6-1

* Fixed a dormant bug in code that imporperly used "$" in 
  mysqlWriteTable().

* Fixed typo in some Rd files; got rid of a few gcc warnings;
  we now silently ignore unrecognized options in mysql config files
  (thanks to Jon McAuliffe for this patch), etc.

* Added method dbColumnInfo(MySQLConnection, "tablename") (similar 
  to Greg Warnes' dbDescribeTable() suggestion).

* mysqlWriteTable() now issues a LOAD LOCAL specifying column names,
  this allows to export data.frames with a subset of fields (as per
  Greg Warnes patch).

* Plugged a memory leak when closing a connection (as per Jeff Horner's 
  patch).

Version 0.6-0

* Added an experimental version of multiple result sets processing.
  There are two new DBI generic function extensions, dbMoreResults() 
  and dbNextResult() that return, respectively, whether there are 
  more results sets and the next result set.  Note that to use this 
  feature on a connection, the connection must be created with the
  CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS client flag.  Also note that not all results 
  need return data.  (Thanks to Crispin Miller for code patches and 
  testing; also thanks to Michal Okonlewski for initial discussions 
  on this.)

* Added connection flags with names after the MySQL C macros 
  CLIENT_COMPRESS, CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES, CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS, etc.

* Added generic function dbEscapeStrings() and a MySQL connection 
  method to escape strings on a connection basis, i.e., each connection 
  can support different char sets.  (Thanks to J. T. Lindgren for the 
  original code.)

* Enabled the package NAMESPACE.  Notice that the mysql*() support 
  functions will be made private in the near future.

* The configure script now also looks in lib64 libraries *before* the 
  default library directories /usr/lib, etc. (thanks to Brian Ripley for 
  this patch and Seth Falcon for additional testing).  Notice that this 
  behavior will select 64-bit libraries over 32-bit on systems that host 
  both R builds, thus in these cases you may want to explicitly use 
  PKG_CPPFLAGS and PKG_LIBS.  See the "R Installation and Administration" 
  for more details, including Section 8 "Choosing between 32- and 64-bit 
  builds".

Version 0.5-11

* Fixed a bug that would crash R with a failed mysql_real_connect().

* dbApply() is now working again (but still experimentally).

* Re-formatted the C code.

[0.5-9 through 0.5-10 were maintenance releases that Seth Falcon
kindly put out.]

Version 0.5-8
 
* Added MySQL error message when failing to connect (thanks to
  Louis Springer for the patch).

* Added code to recognize the newer MySQL types BIT (mapped to
  integers if not too many bytes, otherwise to characters) and 
  NEWDECIMAL.

* Fixed a stack imbalance when cloning a connection, e.g., 
  con2 <- dbConnect(con).

* Remove abbreviation F for FALSE in call to MySQL().

* Added package documentation page.

Version 0.5-7

* Added a method for dbWriteTable to write a table from a text file, e.g.,
  dbWriteTable(con, "tablename", "filename")

* Added the argument "default.file" to dbConnect's method to allow 
  parsing options from an alternate mysql options file.  If specified
  only this file is read, as per the MySQL C API.

* Re-use RSQLite's helper function "dbBuildTableDefinition" that builds 
  an SQL string with a simple "CREATE TABLE" definition appropriate for
  exporting a specified data.frame.
  
* Fixed default in dbReadTable's method to used a table field "row_names" 
  (if it exists) as the row.names() of the output.

* Modified the configure.win to create windows binaries a bit easier.

* Fixed documentation typos.

Version 0.5-6

* Fixed a (potential) bug in the safe.write() where it would use
  the current options(digits), possibly losing precision on double
  precision data.  It now uses digits=17, regardless of option("digits").

* Added a simple configure.win to simplify building the package on 
  windows; removed the inst/libs directory and now provide the MySQL 
  windows binary library in the src/windows directory.

Version 0.5-5

* Fixed documentation typos.

Version 0.5-4

* Fixed 2 problems in configure.in:
  Since the MySQL client library requires libz, but now explicitly
  check for it ourselves;  also we now explicitly check for the GNU 
  getopt_long in the C library and set the C preprocessor macro 
  HAVE_GETOPT_LONG accordingly, which we use to conditionally include 
  or exclude the appropriate C code.

Version 0.5-3

* Fixed a data.frame subsetting problem introduced (uncovered?) with
  the new R 1.8.0 data.frame subsetting semantics.  (The code was in
  safe.write(), to be precise).

* Fixed the vector .MySQLKeywords of reserved words (it was no 100% 
  accurate).

* Yet many more changes to the documentation structure (not the 
  contents) due to yet more changes in the R help system.

* Updated S4R.h to include changes to the .Call API in S-Plus 6.x (untested).

* Built a Windows binary against MySQL 4.0.16 (see inst/libs).

Version 0.5-2

* Added a test to verify whether the MySQL runtime version is different
  from the version used during compilation.  Only a warning is printed
  if the versions differ.

Version 0.5-1

Bug fixes only.

* Fixed the bug in dbWriteTable() incorrectly exporting logicals
  (thanks to christian.ritter@shell.com).  A general mechanism for
  data conversion is still lacking.

* Fixed a problem with issuing mysql_options() with MYSQ_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE
  in version prior to 3.23.49, which is the one introducing this option.
  This bug only appeared when compiling against MySQL 3.23.39 thru 3.23.48

Version 0.5-0

Made the package DBI-compliant (as of DBI 0.1-4) using version S4 style
classes.  Simplified quite a bit the MySQLSupport.R file where most of
the workhorse functions are.    No new functionality in this version.

Version 0.4-6

Ported to Windows with some very nasty porting problems beautifully
solved by BDR (thanks!)

* Added Makevars.win for Windows' sake.

* ifdef the code that parses group default (problems with getop.c).
  The issue is that MySQL C function load_defaults() is not defined
  in libMySQL.lib, only mysqlclient.lib.  Unfortunately the client
  library is only for static, thread-safe applications. (Need to 
  solve this thread-safety issue).

* Need to re-import the libMySQL.lib (see README.windows).

Version 0.4-5
  
A transitional, internal version.  

*  Synchronized the RS-DBI.c and RS-DBI.h with ROracle_0.3-3.

*  Fixed a bug in getopt_long (being assigned to a char, instead
   of an int). Apparently this cause problems only on Yellow Dog 
   Linux versions (thanks to DTL for reporting this).

*  Commented out the S4's idiom "if(IS_LIST(x)) x = AS_LIST(x)
   in the C code when compiled for R (could this idiom introduce 
   memory protection or garbage collection problems in R?)

Version 0.4-4

All but one changes for this point release should be transparent
to all users, and were done for compatibility with version 4 classes.

* Added compatibility for Version 4 style classes and methods. Namely
  don't re-define functions such as as(), new(), show(), etc. when
  running with R 1.4.0 library(methods).  Added a function usingV4()
  that tells us whether we're running with version 4 classes or not
  (works with R and Splus).

* Moved the vector of SQL keywords to .SQL92Keywords in DBI.R.  Also,
  modified make.SQL.names() to use a "keyword" argument (.SQL92Keywords
  by default). (This will allow us to use the same function with 
  simultaneous drivers, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc).  Defined a vector
  of .MySQLKeywords that we pass to make.SQL.names() in 
  assignTable.MySQLConnection.

* Define a new print/show method for MySQLObjects.

Version 0.4-3

NOTE: Next release will most likely implement the emerging R/S DBI
      interface, so I anticipate that the functions will have very
      different names, although the core functionality will be
      pretty much the same.)  Stay tuned.

* Added an *experimental* dbApply() that applies a function to 
  groups of rows, one group at a time, avoiding having to hold the
  data from all the groups in R/S.  It takes a result set, a grouping
  field, plus one or more functions and invokes them when certain
  "fetching events" occur (e.g., at the beginning/end of groups).
  See help(dbApply) for more details.  [I must have(?) a bizarre
  bug in the my C code that causes an R core dump when quantile(x,
  ..., names=T) is invoked inside the R callback function, but
  works fine with quantile(x, ..., names=F) -- any hints will be
  greatly appreciated!]

* Fixed the unimplemented append=T in assignTable() (thanks to
  Jens Nieschulze for the patch).  Also, assignTable() now
  explicitly sets the end-of-line to be '\n' in the call to LOAD
  DATA -- this should fix the incompatibility in Windows that Brian
  Ripley alerted me to (thanks!)  Also fixed the treatment of NA's
  when exporting a data.frame to MySQL. (On input MySQL interprets
  '\N' as an SQL NULL, which is what we use in SQL to denote an NA
  in R/S.)  Re-named the argument from "rownames" to "row.names"
  for consistency with getTable (see below).

* Added row.names= argument to getTable().  The semantics is similar
  (but not identical) to read.table(), namely if row.names is a
  column name or index, the corresponding column is used as row.names
  (provided the column has no duplicate values, of course); a NULL
  or 0 value mean "don't use any field to set the row.names of the
  output data.frame."

* The getTables() method now returns a character vector, instead of
  a data.frame.

* There have been 2 reports of NULL's in MySQL double fields being 
  incorrectly mapped to non-NA's, random (very small) numbers;
  in both cases on Solaris (we couldn't reproduce it on Linux nor
  our local Sun servers).  In one case the problem was traced back
  to multiple versions of the libmysqlclient.so library.  We still
  need to get to the bottom of this:-( 

* Fixed a bug when converting from NULL in a float dbms field to
  a numeric (i.e., double) NA.  

* Fixed a bug that core dumped somewhat randomly when fetching
  a large result set that required extending the receiving vectors of
  the output list.  The cause was not PROTECTing the code expanded
  by SET_LENGTH.  [Somewhat counter to my (buggy) intuition, an
  element *inside* a protected list loses its protection when we
  use SET_LENGTH on it.  See the function RS_DBI_allocOutput in
  RS-DBI.c for the gory details.]  (This problems occurred with R
  1.2.3 and previous versions.)

* Fixed a bug in the data conversions of FIELD_TYPE_LONG into R/S 
  integers that erroneously map them to numeric/double when their
  length was greater than sizeof(Sint).  The current logic (only
  applies to BIGINTs) is that if R's integers, sizeof(Sint), have
  less then BIGINT's 8 bytes then we convert BIGINT to double to
  avoid overflow. This is clearly platform specific. Grrr!

* Fixed a typo (PKG_CPPFLAG, sic) in the instructions generated 
  when configure couldn't find the MySQL header files and libraries.

* Fixed an unobservable bug in the LST_CHR_EL macro in S4R.h.

Version 0.4-2

* (R version) We fixed a problem with load() --- we had correctly elevated 
  this function to generic, but failed to define load.default as the 
  load() in package:base; this problem only manifested when using load from 
  inside other packages (thanks to Prof. Brian Ripley for catching this one.)

* We now include the GNU files "getopt.h" and "getopt.c"  under the "gnu" 
  directory -- this is for the sake of non GNU systems (note that these 
  files are also included in the MySQL source distributions).  We also have 
  a copy of "getopt.h" in the "src" directory (this simplifies installation 
  for users of gcc on Solaris and possibly other non-GNU systems).
  We still need to code this into the R configure script -- see below.

* Updated dbExec documentation, various typos, etc.

Version 0.4-1

* A manual in the Adobe PDF file "RS-MySQL.pdf"

* A lot of changes to the internal C code to have a common source
  for R and Splus 5.x and 6.x 

* A better configure.in (thanks to Torsten Hothorn). I still need
  to add code to check for the GNU getopt.c and getopt.h (as required
  by MySQL) on systems with no GNU tools (e.g., solaris/irix/hpux/aix).

* Added a convenience RS-DBI dbConnect method dbConnect(mgr="character"), 
  e.g., dbConnect("MySQL", ...) to invoke the dbManager("MySQL") 
  prior to opening the actual connection.

* added (almost) trivial convenience RS-DBI functions getTable(), 
  assignTable(), existsTable(), and removeTable().  They all mimic the 
  corresponding R/S get(), assign(), exists(), and remove(), and they 
  all work with a connection object and an sql table name (NOT generic 
  SQL queries); assignTable() assigns a data.frame object (or coerceable) 
  to the database. (These functions provide the basis for "user-defined
  databases in S -- see below.)

* Added support RS-DBI functions make.SQL.names() and isSQLKeyword()
  to create legal SQL identifiers and to test for SQL keywords. 

* Similarly, added a new RS-DBI generic function SQLDataType(dbObjectId, obj) 
  that returns the DBMS data type that most closely can represent 
  the R/S object "obj".  Added the corresponding MySQL method for 
  SQLDataType(MySQLObject, obj).

* (Splus only) 
  Added RS-DBI methods to be able to attach a relational DBMS 
  as an S user-defined S database, e.g., 
     con <- dbConnect("MySQL", group = "vitalAnalysis")
     attach(con, translate = T, max.rows = 10000)
     ls(pos=2)
     x <- CLIENTMAPTABLE

  See ?attach.dbConnection for details.

  Note: *DO NOT* use this facility on large tables --- see the "proxyDBMS"
  library for a more efficient/ambitious interface.

  (I'm not sure this facility belongs in the RS-DBI, but it sure is easiest
  to be bundled here.)

* (Splus only)
  Added a MySQLObject virtual class that extends dbObjectId.

  dbObjectId is now the virtual class for generic remote (DBMS) database 
  objects; each driver then extends it through its own virtual 
  class, e.g., MySQLObject -> dbObjectId.  MySQLObject is virtual and the 
  base class for all MySQL objects (dbManager, dbConnection, etc.); this
  is cleaner, and besides, it simplifies some "mixin" helper classes, 
  e.g., show() for remote objects, SQLDataType(), and so on.)

Version 0.4.0

* Parses $HOME/.my.cnf file.  Added an "rs-dbi" stanza, and
  the S code parses for other stanzas, as specified in
  the argument "group=" in the call to dbConnect.
  For details, see help(MySQL) and the MySQL manual.
